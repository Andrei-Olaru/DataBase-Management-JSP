# DataBase-Management-JSP
This project is a web application built using JavaServer Pages (JSP) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the seamless integration of JSP with a relational database, allowing for efficient management of data through a web interface.

Features:
• **User-Friendly Interface:** The application features a simple, intuitive interface that facilitates easy navigation and interaction.

• **Create Operation:** Users can add new records to the database via a dedicated form. Input validation ensures data integrity before submission.

• **Read Operation:** The application retrieves and displays records from the database in a tabular format. Users can view details of individual records.

• **Update Operation:** Users can edit existing records by selecting them from the table. The form is pre-populated with the current data for convenience.

• **Delete Operation:** Users can remove records from the database with a simple click, accompanied by a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletions.
